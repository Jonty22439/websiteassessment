This is a website for Computer Science. One of the prompts was "My Town- what has been going on in your town? Are people happy? If you walk down the street are there businesses closed or closing down? Why is that? Is it the cost of living or something else? How about employment and jobs?". I think that I could do something about an area near my house that the council wants to turn into a new subdivision. I don't want them to turn it into a subdivision so I think I will make a website about this.

I think that I will change my idea to be simply my town. I could do stuff about what is in Lincoln and what to do.
